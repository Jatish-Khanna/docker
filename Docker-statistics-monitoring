# it is important to monitor the mertics of docker containers
# CPU usage, memory -
# Explore the built-in metrics provided by Docker to give additional visibility to the running containers

#Example starting a container
docker run -d -p 80:80 -e DEFAULT_HOST=proxy.example -v /var/run/docker.sock:/tmp/docker.sock:ro --name nginx jwilder/nginx-proxy:alpine


# Monitor the container 
docker starts nginx

#The environment now has three connected containers running. 

#To view the stats for all these containers you can use pipes and xargs. A
#pipe passes the output from one command into the input of another while xargs 
#allows you to provide this input as arguments to a command.

#By combining the two we can take the list of all our running containers provided by docker ps and use them as the argument for docker stats. \

docker ps -q | xargs docker stats
